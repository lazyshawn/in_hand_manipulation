## Extrinsic Dexterity: In-hand Manipulation with External Force
* “In-hand manipulation” is the ability to reposition an object in the hand.

* **Extrinsic dexterity** and **Intrinsic dexterity**.

By “extrinsic dexterity” we mean the manipulation of an object in the hand,
using resources extrinsic to the hand.
Given that it relies on resources intrinsic to the hand,
we refer to it as “intrinsic dexterity”.

| Dexterity           | Resources                                                   |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| extrinsic dexterity | gravity, surfaces, inertal                                  |
| intrinsic dexterity | wiggle the fingers, or walk them along the object’s surface |



## In-Hand Manipulation via Motion Cones
* We can think of motion cones as a geometric representation of 
the underactuation inherent to frictional contacts.
